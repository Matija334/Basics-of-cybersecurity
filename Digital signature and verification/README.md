# Description
Implementation of a software solution that enables digital signing of any file format (e.g. pdf, doc, txt, jpg, etc.) and verification of the digital signature.

During signing, the program should provide windows for: 
- selecting the file to be signed
- selecting the digital signature to be used for signing the file
- a button to save the signed file

During verification, the program should have windows for uploading:
- the signed file
- the digital signature used for signing the file
- a button to verify the accuracy of the signature
- 
The program should output whether the digital signature matches the signed file.
